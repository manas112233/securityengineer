# SOC Training Tasks - 8 Week Program

## Description  
This 8-week SOC (Security Operations Center) training program is designed to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to operate effectively within a SOC environment. Through a combination of theoretical learning and hands-on practical exercises, students will explore various aspects of SOC operations, including incident response, tool usage, threat detection, and architecture design. Each week focuses on specific topics and tasks, building upon the previous week's learning objectives.
