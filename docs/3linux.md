## **Week 1: Linux & Shell Scripting**

### **Task 1: Understanding the Linux Directory Structure**
**Objective:** Gain familiarity with Linux file system and key directories.

ðŸ”¹ Research and document the purpose of key directories such as `/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`, `/var`, `/usr`, and `/tmp`.
ðŸ”¹ Navigate the Linux file system using commands like `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, and `tree`.

### **Task 2: Essential Linux Commands**
**Objective:** Learn and practice essential Linux commands for file manipulation and process management.

ðŸ”¹ Compile a list of frequently used Linux commands (e.g., `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`, `grep`, `find`, `chmod`, `chown`, `ps`, `kill`, `tar`, `zip`, `unzip`).
ðŸ”¹ Execute and document the behavior of these commands with different arguments and options.

### **Task 3: Understanding and Managing Path Variables**
**Objective:** Learn about the Linux `PATH` variable and its role in command execution.

ðŸ”¹ Explain the significance of `PATH`.
ðŸ”¹ View and modify path variables using commands like `echo $PATH` and `export PATH`.

### **Task 4: System Monitoring and Resource Management**
**Objective:** Utilize Linux commands to monitor and manage system performance.

ðŸ”¹ Practice using commands like `top`, `htop`, `df`, `du`, `free`, `uptime`, and `vmstat`.
ðŸ”¹ Document the purpose, usage, and output of each command.

### **Task 5: Network Management Commands**
**Objective:** Learn and apply essential Linux networking commands.

ðŸ”¹ Use commands like `ifconfig`, `ip`, `ping`, `netstat`, `ss`, `traceroute`, and `nmap` to troubleshoot and manage network connections.
ðŸ”¹ Document findings and analyze network behaviors.

### **Task 6: Security & Permissions in Linux**
**Objective:** Understand and manage file permissions and security measures.

ðŸ”¹ Learn how to use `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.
ðŸ”¹ Explore user, group, and other permission concepts.
ðŸ”¹ Implement basic security measures and document the process.

### **Task 7: Log Files and System Logs**
**Objective:** Analyze system logs and track system activity.

ðŸ”¹ Identify key log files in `/var/log` (e.g., `syslog`, `auth.log`, `dmesg`).
ðŸ”¹ Use `tail`, `less`, `cat`, and `grep` to analyze logs.

### **Task 8: Basics of Shell Scripting**
**Objective:** Write simple shell scripts to automate tasks.

ðŸ”¹ Understand the structure of a shell script.
ðŸ”¹ Write and execute basic scripts involving variables, loops, and conditional statements.

## **Additional Research Topics**
ðŸ“Œ **Process Management:** Understanding `ps`, `kill`, `nice`, and `jobs`.
ðŸ“Œ **User Management:** Managing users and groups (`useradd`, `passwd`, `groupadd`).
ðŸ“Œ **Package Management:** Using `apt`, `yum`, and `dnf`.
ðŸ“Œ **Crontab & Scheduling:** Automating tasks with `cron` jobs.
ðŸ“Œ **Firewall & Security:** Configuring `iptables` and `ufw`.
