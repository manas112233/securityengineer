# Networking and Network Security - 3 Week Program

## Description
This three-week program is designed to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of networking fundamentals and network security concepts relevant to cybersecurity. Through a series of structured tasks, students will explore networking protocols, devices, addressing schemes, security technologies, threat detection, and defense strategies. The program emphasizes hands-on learning using free solutions and tools available online.

## Week 1: Foundations of Networking and Network Security

### Task 1: Networking Fundamentals
#### Objective: Understand the OSI and TCP/IP models and the functions of each layer.
- Study the OSI and TCP/IP models and create a comparative analysis.
- Research and summarize the differences between connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) protocols.

### Task 2: Network Protocols
#### Objective: Explore TCP/IP suite protocols and common application layer protocols.
- Create a detailed guide on TCP/IP suite protocols (TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP).
- Investigate and document the purpose and usage scenarios of common application layer protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and FTP.

### Task 3: Understanding Network Devices
#### Objective: Explore network devices and their security perspectives.
- Investigate the functionalities of routers, switches, hubs, and their roles in network security.
- Compare and contrast the security implications of each network device.

## Week 2: Advanced Networking Concepts and Security Technologies

### Task 4: Network Addressing and Identification
#### Objective: Study IP addressing, subnetting, CIDR notation, and MAC addresses.
- Explore IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes, subnetting, and CIDR notation.
- Investigate MAC addresses, ARP, and MAC address spoofing.

### Task 5: Network Security Technologies
#### Objective: Research encryption protocols, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
- Research SSL/TLS, IPsec encryption protocols, and their strengths/weaknesses.
- Investigate different IDS/IPS solutions, their features, and deployment considerations.

### Task 6: Network Access and Privacy
#### Objective: Explore ISP, VPN, proxies, and their roles in network privacy and security.
- Understand the concepts of ISP, VPN, and proxies.
- Explore their roles in network privacy, security, and anonymity.

## Week 3: Network Monitoring, Threats, and Defense

### Task 7: Network Monitoring and Analysis
#### Objective: Conduct network traffic analysis and analyze network logs for security threats.
- Use Wireshark or similar tools to analyze network traffic for anomalous behavior.
- Analyze network logs and events to detect and investigate security incidents.
- Complete this challenge and create a report: [Poisoned Credentials Challenge](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/poisonedcredentials/)

### Task 8: Network Threats and Vulnerabilities
#### Objective: Research common network threats and vulnerabilities.
- Compile a list of common network threats (malware, DDoS, phishing) and vulnerabilities.
- Identify and document network misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.

### Task 9: Network Defense Strategies
#### Objective: Develop network defense strategies and incident response plans.
- Develop a network defense strategy incorporating firewalls, IDS/IPS, and other security mechanisms.
- Create an incident response plan outlining procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from network security incidents.

### Project: Network Security Implementation
#### Objective: Implement network security measures based on the learned concepts and strategies.
- Implement firewall rules to restrict network traffic.
- Deploy an open-source IDS/IPS solution for threat detection.
- Document the implementation process, including configurations and rationale.
