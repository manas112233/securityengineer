# Level 6: Security Automation and Advanced Topics  

## One-Week Program: Security Automation and Advanced Topics  

This program provides hands-on experience in security automation using Python. Participants will learn to automate network tasks, analyze security data, and implement file integrity monitoring with incident reporting.  

## **Day 1-2: Network Simulation and Scripting with Python**  

### **Task 1: Network Simulation and Scripting with Python**  

**Objective:** Use Python to simulate network tasks and automate related processes.  

#### **Activities:**  
- **Socket Programming:** Write Python scripts to simulate client-server communication using sockets.  
- **Network Scanning:** Create scripts to scan a range of IP addresses and identify active hosts using the `scapy` library.  
- **Log Analysis:** Simulate network log files and write scripts to parse and analyze these logs.

## **Day 3-4: Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib**  

### **Task 2: Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib**  

**Objective:** Analyze and visualize security-related data using Pandas and Matplotlib.  

#### **Activities:**  
- Install and set up Pandas and Matplotlib.  
- Use Pandas to clean and preprocess security data.  
- Create visualizations with Matplotlib to identify trends and patterns in the data.  
- Develop a complete data analysis project using a sample security dataset.

## **Day 5-7: File Integrity Monitoring and Incident Reporting with Jira API**  

### **Task 3: File Integrity Monitoring and Incident Reporting with Jira API**  

**Objective:** Develop a Python script to monitor file integrity changes in a folder and automatically create a Jira ticket for detected incidents.  

#### **Activities:**  
- Implement a script to calculate and store hash values (MD5 or SHA256) of files in a specified folder.  
- Set up the script to run periodically (e.g., every hour) to compare current file hash values with previously stored values.  
- Configure the script to detect changes in file integrity (hash values) and trigger an alert or action.  
- Integrate the script with the Jira API to automatically create an incident ticket when file integrity changes are detected.  
- Test the script to ensure proper functionality, including API integration and incident ticket creation.
